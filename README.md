# OpenSprinkler-Tank_fill
Add external functionality to fill or drain an auxiliary tank with or without OpenSprinkler

I have an auto top off for my pool and among installing a sprinkler system, using OpenSprinker as the controller. A master valve was installed that now controls the sprinklers and the water supply at the pool.

This gives an artificial external functionality, to have OpenSprinkler open the master valve (in one hour increments) in order for the auto top off to work.

The code is installed onto an Arduino UNO, although it should be able to be installed on any Arduino with minor alterations. The code is heavily commented.

The code is offered to the public with no warranties, either expressed or implied.
